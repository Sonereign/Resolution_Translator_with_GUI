A simple app with GUI to help translate on screen points (x, y) and regions(top, left, width, height) from a resolution to another.

To translate (x, y) screen coords set current(old), target(new) resolution, Coords X and Coords Y and hit calculate button.

The same with Region Coords.

It can take many improvements however I'm too lazy to do as the app is made for personal use.

Enjoy the tool.
